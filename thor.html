		<h3 id= Thor>Storyline</h3>
			<blockquote><p><span class="fun">For Fun: Movie took 365 days to complete shooting and 700 days post production.</span></p> 
				<p> "The warrior Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is cast out of the fantastic realm of Asgard by his father Odin (Sir Anthony Hopkins) for his arrogance and sent to Earth to live amongst humans. Falling in love with scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) teaches Thor much-needed lessons, and his new-found strength comes into play as a villain from his homeland sends dark forces toward Earth.

                <ul> 
			<li><b>Thor proves a strong contender...8/10</b></li> </ul>
			
                   <blockquote> <p>"In the pantheon of Marvel Superheroes, from my vantage point, Thor is a second-tier player. Even amongst non-obsessive comic aficionados, such as myself, Thor doesn't quite have the readership draw or the common familiarity in the public that heroes such as Spider-Man, Batman, Superman, etc., have."
                    </p> </blockquote>

<ul><li><b>One of the best MCU stories and productions...9/10</b></li>  </ul>
                  <blockquote>  "Who knew Thor was the perfect drinking buddy and is domesticated lol? Perfect writing. Perfect directing. Perfect casting. Perfect cinematography. Perfect amount of S/VFX. Perfect score. Perfect comedy/drama/thrills. Etc" </blockquote> 
                     

<ul><li><b>Perhaps not the definitive version, but definitely a worthwhile take...</b></li> </ul>
                    <blockquote> "Couldn't even finish this drivel... Firstly : Pattinson is a good actor but doesn't fit Batman's role ...Film is way too long and boring , the action is underwhelming ...Overall a big disappointment... Can't recommend it at all..."</blockquote> 
                    

<ul><li><b>Entertaining Adventure...7/10</b></li></ul>
                   
<blockquote> "In 965 D.C., in Tornsberg, Norway, the Frost Giants from Jotunheim led by King Laufey (Colm Feore) attack the locals, and the Allfather Odin (Anthony Hopkins) and the warriors of Asgard protect the humans and win the battle against the invaders. They take their source of power and bring it to Asgard and they start an armistice with Jotunheim.."
